# GPT-Autocomplete

A quick implementation of GPT-2 as a general purposed sentence completion.

While running the script, any text typed into the `input.txt` file will be contextually interpreted and the full sentence with the next predicted word will be appended to the `output.txt` file. This functionality could be easily implemented in various programs and extensions but would be better with fine tuning GPT-2 through application specific data.
